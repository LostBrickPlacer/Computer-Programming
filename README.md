# Computer-Programming
A compilation of all my code written in high school to date, shared with whoever for free.
Almost all the programs written here are from Liem's classes, feel free to use any and all files, on the one condition you actually still learn stuff.
All the files in this repo should work fine, without needing any external files/programs.


The resources for the HTML lessons (images, examples, etc) are all in the /0_Resources/ folder, which is at the top of the /HTML/ folder.
The files are all in the folders where they are required too, but are seperate for your convenience.


All files past Unit 02 in the C++ section require the 'common.h' header, which is included at the bototm of the folder.
If you are going to use only a single file from C++, make sure to change the header files or else the code won't run properly.
A very simple fix, and I totally could have just done it myself, but I'm lazy and don't care in the slighest.


Remember that these folders may contain information related to me (LostBrickPlacer), and I ask you to please respect my privacy.
Change the information if you're going to use the files too, honestly that's just common sense.

Please be aware of the fact that these lessons and files are up to date as of 06-21-2023, and may not remain always the right solution to the projects/assignments.

Happy programming!

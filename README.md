# Computer-Programming
A compilation of all my code written in high school to date.
Almost all the programs written here are from Liem's classes, feel free to use any and all files, on the one condition you actually still learn stuff.

All the files in this repo should work fine, without needing any external files/programs.
The only exception to this is the C++ folder, where most, if not all files past Unit 02 require the 'common.h' header.

'common.h' is included in the C++ root folder, and should be working fine.
If you are going to use a single file from C++, make sure to change the header files or else the code won't run properly.

A very simple fix, and I totally could have just done it myself, but I'm lazy and don't care.

Happy programming!

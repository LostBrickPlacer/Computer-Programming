# Computer-Programming
A compilation of all my code written in high school to date.

All the files in this repo should work fine, without needing any external files/programs.
The only exception to this is the C++ folder, where most, if not all files past Unit 02 require the 'common.h' header.

'common.h' is included in the C++ root folder, and should be working fine.
If you are going to use a single file from C++, make sure to change the header files or else the code won't run properly.

A very simple fix, and I totally could have just done it myself, but I'm lazy and don't care.

Happy programming!

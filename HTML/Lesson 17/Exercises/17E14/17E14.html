        <h1>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST</h1>
        <p>
            <pre>
Tale as old as time
                
True as it can be
                
Barely even friends
                
Then somebody bends
                
Unexpectedly
                
Just a little change
                
Small to say the least
                
Both a little scared
                
Neither one prepared
                
Beauty and the beast
                
Ever just the same
                
Ever a surprise
                
Ever as before and ever just as sure as the sun will rise
                
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
                
Ever just the same
                
Ever a surprise
                
Ever as before
                
Ever just as sure
                
As the sun will rise
                
(Oh, oh, oh)
                
Tale as old as time (ooh, ooh, ooh)
                
Tune as old as song
                
Bittersweet and strange
                
Finding you can change
                
Learning you were wrong
                
Certain as the sun
                
Certain as the sun
                
Rising in the east
                
Tale as old as time
                
Song as old as rhyme
                
Beauty and the beast
                
Tale as old as time
                
Song as old as rhyme
                
Beauty and the beast
                
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)
                
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
                
Beauty and the beast

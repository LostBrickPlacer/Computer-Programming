        <p>
        What is a computer virus?
        <p>
        A virus is a rogue computer program, typically a short program designed to disperse copies of itself to otther computers and disrupt those computers' normal operations. A computer virus usually attaches or inserts itself to or in a file or the boot sector of a disk and is spread via floppy disks, networks or on-line services. Although some viruses are harmless, others can destoy or corrupt data or cause an operating system or applications program to malfunction. Antivirus programs and hardware have been developed to combat viruses by searching for evidence of a virus program, isolating infected files, and removing viruses from a computer's software.

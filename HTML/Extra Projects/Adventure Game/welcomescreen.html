            Welcome! Even as you are reading this, it is too late. You are already trapped. It is impossible to go back, the only direction now is forward.
            <br />
            Foward where, I hear you ask? Forward into the realm of <span class="wingdings">Fancy Name</span>! The realm of <span class="wingdings">Fancy Name</span> is a place that exists both outside and between reality. A place where anything, everything and yet, nothing is possible.

            Now! With that out of the way, let's get you outfitted for the <s>painful and gruesome</s> exiting and action packed adventure you're about to have! This may require re-writing your entire being, but there's only a 4% chance that you'll reject the change and immediately die.

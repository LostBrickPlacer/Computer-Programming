        <h1>Castle Path</h1>

        <p>
            You begin your journey, leaving the safety of Pearlsea Castle for the first time in your entire life. The only things you're taking with you are your enchanted sword, Truthbreaker, a set of armour desperately in need of polishing and a horse, yet to be named.
        </p>
        <p>
            You decide to name your horse before heading off to one of the three nearby villages. What do you name it?
            What do you want to name your horse? <input type="text" name="horsename" id="horsename" placeholder="Name your horse">
            <button type="button" onclick="horsename()" id="horsebtn">Submit</button>
        </p>
        <p id="forcedhorsetext">
            You named your horse <b>[PLACEHOLDER HORSE NAME]</b>! What a great name :)
            <br />
            <span id="haha">haha you thought you got to actually pick? I'm not smart enough to make that work.</span>
        </p>

        <br />
        <br />

        <p>
            With your newly named horse, you think it's finally time to head out for real now.
            <br />
            Pick which of the three villages you should go to.
            <br /><br />

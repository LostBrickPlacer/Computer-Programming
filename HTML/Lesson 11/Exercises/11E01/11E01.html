            A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection, refraction and dispertion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky. It takes the form of a multicoloured arc. Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of the sky opposite from the sun. <!-- Did you know that rainbows are also perfect circles when viewed from above? -->

        If you are visiting this website, it means you clicked on the apple, well done. 
        <br />
        The journey has just begun, however.
        <p>
        Next, you need to go to the amazon rainforest, and find the palm tree with the smiley face etched into it.
        <br />
        From there, turn exactly 32Â° and walk twelve and a half paces to your left.
        <p>
        If you follow all of the instructions above perfectly, to the letter, you will trip on a rock, half buried in the dirt.
        Look on the bottom of the rock and there will be a small red arrow painted on the bottom. 
        <br />
        (if the arrow has faded enough so that you can no longer see it, then there is no continuing anymore)
        <p>
        Point the arrow at yourself, close your eyes, and throw the rock as hard as you can, straight up, without taking a single step.
        head in the direction the arrow lands.
        <br />
        If for whatever reason, the arrow points south, go West. If the arrow points in any other direction, head that way, <u>NEVER</u> go south, even if that's the way you came from.
        <br />
        From there, you will find further instructions on a stone slab sitting suspicuously in the middle of a very convientley placed clearing.

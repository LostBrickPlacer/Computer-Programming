            <i>There are three reasons why Canada is the best country in the world.</i> First, Canada has an excellent health care system. All Canadians have access to  medical services at a reasonable price. Second, Canada has a high standard of education. Students are taught by well-trained teachers and are encouraged to continue studying at university. Finally, Canada's cities are clean and efficiently managed. Canadian cities have many parks and lots of space for people to live. As a result, Canada is a desirable place to live.

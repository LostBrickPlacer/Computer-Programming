        <p>
        My recipe for delicious garlic toast requires some ingredients. Here's what you 
        need for garlic toast.
        <p>
        <ul>List of Needed Items
            <li>Garlic Powder or Crushed Garlic</li>
            <li>Some Slices of Bread</li>
            <li>Toaster</li>
            <li>Butter Knife</li>
            <li>Butter or Margarine</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <div class="instructions">
        The first thing you need to do is take the bread and spread a little bit of 
        margarine or butter on it using the butter knife. Then take the crushed or 
        powdered garlic and sprinkle it generously on the bread. Then pop it in the 
        toaster and press the toast button. <span class="warning">Be careful not to burn yourself!</span> When it's 
        done, use tongs to grab the hot toast and put it on a plate. <span class="capitals">Then it's 
        ready to serve!</span>
            </div>

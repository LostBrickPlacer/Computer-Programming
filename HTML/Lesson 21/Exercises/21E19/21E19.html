            Should all hospitals use electronic health records?
        </div>
        <p>
            Electronic health records should used because they are permanent. Unlike paper records, electronic health records do not wear or break down over time. They are stored on computer hard drives and servers, so their data remains intact despite the years that pass or what happens to the provider. Smith mentions that over time, many hospitals or organizitions that use paper records lose track of them or find that they are destroyed due to fire or flooding Electronic health records, on the other hand, are disaster-proof and will last as long as they serves that store them are operational. Because of this permanence, they should be used hospitals instead of paper records.

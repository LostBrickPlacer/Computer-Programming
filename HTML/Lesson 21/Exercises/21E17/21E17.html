            Instagram is an American photo and video-sharing social networking service owned by Facebook, Inc.
It was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, and launched in October 2010 on iOS.
<br /><br />
A version for Android devices was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited website
interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app on June 15, 2014 and an app for Windows 10 tablets and
computers in October 2016.
<br /><br />
The app allows users to upload photos and videos, which can be edited with filters and organized with
tags and location information. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers.
<br /><br />
Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, and view trending content. Users can like
photos and follow other users to add their content to a feed.

            Mount Seymour is a mountain located in Mount Seymour Provincial Park in the District of North Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada. It is a part of the North Shore Mountains, rising to the north from the shores of Burrard Inlet and Indian Arm to a summit
of 1,449 m (4,754 ft) above the Indian River and Deep Cove neighbourhoods. Mount Seymour is most commonly identified for its
ski area of the same name, and as a popular hiking area. It is named in honour of Frederick Seymour, second governor of the
Colony of British Columbia. The name is used to refer to the ridge although the main summit is one of several, and is also known
as Third Peak.

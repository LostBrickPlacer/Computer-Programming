            osu! is a free-to-play rhythm game primarily developed, published, and created by Dean "peppy" Herbert. Inspired by iNiS' rhythm game Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, it was written in C# on the .NET framework, and was released for Microsoft Windows on 16 September 2007. The game has throughout the years been ported to macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.

            Asides from Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, the game has been inspired by titles such as Taiko no Tatsujin, Beatmania IIDX, Elite Beat Agents, O2Jam, StepMania and DJMax. The game is heavily community-oriented, with all beatmaps and playable songs being community-made through the in-game map editor. Four different game modes exist, offering various ways to play a beatmap, which can also be combined with addable modifiers, increasing or decreasing the difficulty.
            <p>
            The original osu!standard mode remains the most popular to date and as of March 2022, the game has 19,872,585 monthly active users according to the game's global country leaderboards.

            Geometry Dash is a series of music platforming video games developed by Swedish developer Robert Topala, also known as RobTop. The first game, known simply as Geometry Dash, was released on August 13, 2013, on iOS and Android, and a Steam version was released on December 22, 2014. In Geometry Dash, players control the movement of an icon and navigate along music-based levels, while avoiding obstacles such as spikes that instantly destroy the icon on impact.

            Geometry Dash currently consists of 21 official levels. It is well known for its extensive level creation system, where players can create their own custom courses, share them online, and play courses designed by other players. More than 79 million custom levels have been created. In addition to the official levels, certain user-created levels have been featured in in-game content, such as map packs, gauntlets, the hall of fame, daily non-demon level, weekly demon, and the search bar. In-game currency, such as stars, secret coins, user coins (verified only), mana orbs, or diamonds can be obtained from chests, or official levels (in which secret coins can only be obtained) and user-created levels (in which user coins can only be obtained).

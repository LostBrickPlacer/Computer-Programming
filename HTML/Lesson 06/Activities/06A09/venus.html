        <i>Venus</i> is a beautiful, cloudy planet. It is the second closest planet to the sun and is just slightly 
        smaller than the Earth. It rains sulphuric acid and volcanoes explode continuously. It's always boiling hot on 
        <i>Venus</i> because the clouds hold heat in like an oven. The atmosheric pressure is so tremendous that all 
        spacecraft that have landed on <i>Venus</i> have been crushed within hours.

        <b>Mercury</b> is the closest planet to the sun. It was named after the Roman Messenger because it goes around the sun
        really fast. It is desolate and empty, like the Earth's moon. During the day, it boils, and during the night 
        it's freezing. <b>Mercury</b> is the second smallest planet in the solar system.

        So I remember watching this movie once, and it was about some guy, he did some things, and 
        some stuff happened. Honestly it was a pretty great movie, and the cast was full of people 
        that were all actors. The plot was a good story and the characters in the movie all did 
        various actions during the film. The movie was under 24 hours length, and it was in a 
        theater that I watched it. There were other people in the theater with me, also watching 
        the movie that I was watching during the time the movie was playing. The one thing that I 
        do remember from the movie were the lyrics to this really cool song, here, I'll type them 
        out for you now:
        <p>
        "We're no strangers to love<br />
        You know the rules and so do I<br />
        A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br />
        You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br />
        I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br />
        Gotta make you understand<br />
        Never gonna give you up<br />
        Never gonna let you down<br />
        Never gonna run around and desert you<br />
        Never gonna make you cry<br />
        Never gonna say goodbye<br />
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br />
        We've known each other for so long<br />
        Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it<br />
        Inside we both know what's been going on<br />
        We know the game and we're gonna play it<br />
        And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br />
        Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br />
        Never gonna give you up<br />
        Never gonna let you down<br />
        Never gonna run around and desert you<br />
        Never gonna make you cry<br />
        Never gonna say goodbye<br />
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br />
        Never gonna give you up<br />
        Never gonna let you down<br />
        Never gonna run around and desert you<br />
        Never gonna make you cry<br />
        Never gonna say goodbye<br />
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br />
        Never gonna give, never gonna give<br />
        (Give you up)<br />
        We've known each other for so long<br />
        Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it<br />
        Inside we both know what's been going on<br />
        We know the game and we're gonna play it<br />
        I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br />
        Gotta make you understand<br />
        Never gonna give you up<br />
        Never gonna let you down<br />
        Never gonna run around and desert you<br />
        Never gonna make you cry<br />
        Never gonna say goodbye<br />
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br />
        Never gonna give you up<br />
        Never gonna let you down<br />
        Never gonna run around and desert you<br />
        Never gonna make you cry<br />
        Never gonna say goodbye<br />
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br />
        Never gonna give you up<br />
        Never gonna let you down<br />
        Never gonna run around and desert you<br />
        Never gonna make you cry<br />
        Never gonna say goodbye"

        There we go, those were the lyrics to the song that was playing during the movie that I was 
        watching while the movie was playing in the theater that I went to with other people to watch 
        because the movie was playing at that time.

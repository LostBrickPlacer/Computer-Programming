                <b>Thomas Stanley Holland</b> (born 1 June 1996) is an English actor. <br />His accolades 
                include a British Academy Film Award, a Guinness World Record and an appearance 
                on the Forbes 30 Under 30 Europe list. <br />Some publications have called him one of 
                the best actors under 30 years of age. <p>He is best known for his role as Spider-Man 
                in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, although he stars in many other movies such as 
                <i>Uncharted</i>, <i>Cherry</i>. <br />He has also played voice roles in <i>Spies in Disguise</i>, 
                <i>Onward</i>, and <i>Dolittle</i>.
                <p>
                In his career, he has quickly made a name for himself, and also has a reputation of spoling the 
                marvel movies he's in. <br />He's done it enough times that he's no longer given the full move script 
                in efforts to keep him from giving away the plot.

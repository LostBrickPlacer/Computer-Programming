            BLUE WHALES
        </h2>
        <p>
            The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal belonging to the baleen whale parvorder, Mysticeti. At up to 29.9 meters (98 ft) in length and with a maximum recorded weight of 173 tonnes (190 short tons) it is the largest animal known to have ever existed. Long and slender, the blue whale's body can be various shades of blush-gray donally and somewhatlighter underneath. There are at least three distinct subspecies: B. m. musculus of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia of the Southern Ocean and B. m. brevicauda (also known as the pygmy blue whale) found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean. B. m. indica, found in the Indian Ocean, may be another subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small crustaceans known as krill.

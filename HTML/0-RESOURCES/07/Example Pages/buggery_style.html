My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner with low grade narcolepsy 
and a penchant for buggery.  My mother was a French woman named Chloe with webbed feet. 
My childhood was typical: summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring, we'd make meat helmets.  
When I was fourteen I received my first scribe.  
When I was sixteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved me. <P>

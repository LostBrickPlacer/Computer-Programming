My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery.  My mother was a French woman named Chloe with webbed feet.  My childhood was typical: summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring, we'd make meat helmets.  When I was fourteen I received my first scribe.  When I was sixteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved me. <P>

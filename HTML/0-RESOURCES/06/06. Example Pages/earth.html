The <FONT COLOR="light blue">Earth</FONT> is our planet.  It's the third rock from the sun, and it's covered in liquid water.  It contains a molten core that swirls and churns, creating the magnetic field that makes our compasses work.  Clouds float high in the atmosphere and rain down refreshing drops of water on the <FONT COLOR="light blue">Earth</FONT>'s life forms.

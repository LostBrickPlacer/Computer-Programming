<B>Mercury</B> is the closest planet to the sun.  It was named after the Roman messenger because it goes around the sun really fast.  It is desolate and empty, like the Earth's moon.  During the day, it boils, and during the day, it's freezing.  <B>Mercury</B> is the second smallest planet in the Solar System.

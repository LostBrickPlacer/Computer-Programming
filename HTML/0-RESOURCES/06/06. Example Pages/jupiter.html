<BODY BGCOLOR="orange">

<FONT COLOR="fuchsia">Jupiter</FONT> is named after the leader of the Roman gods, and it is quite fitting since <FONT COLOR="fuchsia">Jupiter</FONT> has more mass than the rest of the planets combined.  It's so humoungous that it could have become a star like the sun if it was just a bit bigger.  It has such a strong gravitational pull that it has a solar-system-like collection of moons orbitting around it.

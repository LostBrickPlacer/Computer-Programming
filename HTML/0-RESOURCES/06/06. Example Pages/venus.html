<I>Venus</I> is a beautiful, cloudy planet.  It's the second closest planet to the sun and is just slightly smaller than the Earth.  It rains sulphuric acid and volcanoes explode continuously.  It's always boiling hot on Venus because the clouds hold heat in like an oven.  The atmospheric pressure is so tremendous that all spacecraft that have landed on <I>Venus</I> have been crushed within hours.

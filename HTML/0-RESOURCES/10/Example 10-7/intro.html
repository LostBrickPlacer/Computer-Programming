Hello friends, today I'll take my time of the day and make a guide on which game to pick
as your introduction to the Megami Tensei series. Please remmeber that this is my opinion and it really 
depends whether you enjoy these games or not. I'm dividing these into 4 sections 'cause 
i can't cover everything in one page (i can but i'm i gonna???) Also I'm not covering the dancing games 
(for obvious reasons), unrelated games that are in the
same universe (Catherine and Tokyo Mirage Sessions) and some less
 known sub series 'cause I'm lazy ^.^ <p>

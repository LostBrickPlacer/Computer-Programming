            <span class="earth">Earth</span> is the third planet from the sun and the only astronomical object to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, <span class="earth">Earth</span> formed over 4.5 billion years ago. <span class="earth">Earth's</span> gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and Moon, which is <span class="earth">Earth's</span> only natural satellite. <span class="earth">Earth</span> orbits the sun in 365.256 days, a period known as an <span class="earth">Earth</span> sidereal year. During this time, <span class="earth">Earth</span> rotates around it's axis 266.256 times. <span class="earth">Earth's</span> axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on <span class="earth">Earth</span>. The gravitational interaction between <span class="earth">Earth</span> and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes <span class="earth">Earth's</span> orientation on its axis, and gradually slows it's rotation. <span class="earth">Earth</span> is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.

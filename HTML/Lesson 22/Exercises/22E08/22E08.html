            Although recent cooler conditions have brought some respite, the states of New South Wales and Victoria are once again
braced for the return of severe fire danger - with high temperatures and gusty winds forecast over the next few days.
Some 27 people have so far been killed - including four firefighters - and an estimated 10 million hectares (100,000 sq
km or 15.6 million acres) of bush, forest and parks across Australia has burned.
<br />
    There have been fires in every Australian state, but New South Wales has been hardest hit. Blazes have torn through
    bushland, wooded areas, and national parks like the Blue Mountains. Some of Australia's largest cities have also
    been affected, including Melbourne and Sydney -- where fires have damaged homes in the outer suburbs and thick
    plumes of smoke have blanketed the urban center. Earlier in December, the smoke was so bad in Sydney that air
    quality measured 11 times the "hazardous" level.

        <h1>life guards shared 10 facts to help you stay safe in the water</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>When lifeguards ask you not to run, they mean it.</li>
                <li>It's prohibited to dig deep holes in the sand for a reason.</li>
                <li>Holding your breath is not a game.</li>
                <li>Beware of sea creatures.</li>
                <li>Stay where lifeguards can see you. If you can't see them, they can't see you.</li>
                <li>Stay away from piers.</li>
                <li>If you are in a rip current, swim parallel to the beach.</li>
                <li>Wakling barefoot is a bad idea.</li>
                <li>Swim only when you're sober.</li>
                <li>Stop talking to lifeguards without a good reason. It is distracting.</li>
            </ol>

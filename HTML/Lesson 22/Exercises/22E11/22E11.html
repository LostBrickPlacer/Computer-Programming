        <h1>TACOS</h1>
        <div class="o1">
            A taco is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small hand-sized corn or wheat tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is then folded around the filling and eaten by hand.

        <p>
            A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, vegetables, and cheese, allowing great versitality and variety. They are often garnished with various condiments, such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream. And vegetables, such as lettuce, onion, tomatoes and chilies. Tacos are a common form of anojitos, or Mexican street food, which have spread around the world. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Tacos can be contrasted with similar foods, such as burrito, which are often much larger and rolled together rather than folded, taquitos which are rolled and fried, or chapulas/tostadas, in which the tortilla is fried before filling.

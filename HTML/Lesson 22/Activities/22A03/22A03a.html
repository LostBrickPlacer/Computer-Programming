            In this example, the image is taller than the element containing it, and is floated, so it overflows ouside of it's container:
        </p>
        <div>
            <img class="img1" src="pineapple.jpg" alt="Pineapple" width="170px" height="170px">
            The pineapple is a tropical plant with an edible fruit, also called a pineapple, and the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae.
        </div>
        <p style="clear: right;">
            Add a clearfix class with overflow: auto; to the containing element to fix this problem.
        </p>
        <div class="clearfix">
            <img class="img2" src="pineapple.jpg" alt="Pineapple" width="170px" height="170px">
            in 20C, Hawaii was a dominant producer of pineapples, especially for the US, but in 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, and the Philippines accounted for nearly one-third of the world's production of pineapples.

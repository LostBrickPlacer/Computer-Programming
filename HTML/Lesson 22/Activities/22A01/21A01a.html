            The pineapple is a tropical plant with an edible fruit; it is the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae. The pineapple is indegenous to South America where it has been cultivated for many centuries. The introduction of the pineapple cultivation to Europe in the 17C made it a significant cultural icon of luxury. Since the 1820s pineapple has been comercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical plantations and it is the third most important tropical fruit in the world production.

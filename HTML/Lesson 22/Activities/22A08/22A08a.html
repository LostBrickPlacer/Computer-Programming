            <p>One day, my father, he told me
                "Son, don't let it slip away"
                He took me in his arms, I heard him say
                "When you get older
                Your wild heart will live for younger days
                Think of me if ever you're afraid"
                He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
                So live a life you will remember"</p>

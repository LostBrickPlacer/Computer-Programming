            Daisy flowers represent innocence and they are usually linked to children or newborns. These flowers were often used in flower arrangements as gifts for children and their parents. This flower symbolizes innocence because it is also a symbol of new beginning and we all know that children are our hope for a better day and are new beginnings and hope for the future.

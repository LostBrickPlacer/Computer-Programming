            <h2>All about arts</h2>
            <p>
                The NWSS Drama department provides students with exiting opportunities to develop and explore the dramatic arts. Students study improvisation, stage movement, vocal technique, character development, script writing and production. Every second year, a major musical is cast and produced by staff and students at NWSS and performed in the historic MASSEY THEATERE. Stage plays are produced in off musical years and range from dramatic to comedic. Senior drama students take part in NWSS' anti-bullying campaign called "ROCKSOLID". Since 2004, NWSS drama has partnered with the NWPD to help end bullying. Drama and creative writing students write and perform plays to help bring change and to create bully-free communities. New in 2016, NWSS drama students also have opportunities to travel to NYC and other future locations to see plays.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Prior to the 1860s, the site of the old school building was a public cemetery where many of the prominent citizens of New Westminster were interred. After development in the 1870s, the remains of those buried were transferred to the Fraser Cemetery, located elsewhere in the city. During the Second World War, the corner of 10th Avenue and 8th, where the old school was located, was leased to the Federal Government. The site served as a soldiers barracks, used for training and housing the Royal New Wesminster Regiment. After World War II, the barracks were moved to the university of British Columbia and the rest of the cemetary was demolished. Finally, in 1948, the public works yard was moved and the site was transferred to the New Westminster School Board for the construction of offices and a new (now old) high school.

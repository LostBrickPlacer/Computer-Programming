                After the disappointment that is Fates, I really hoped that FE can find its ground again with a strong title. And did they delivera great game. Fire Emblem: Three Houses is a tactical role-playing game with life-sim element and heavy emphasis onstrategywhere you play as a professor in a royal institute. The graphics look great most of the game however i find that thearchitecturein the game can be either hit or miss. The best way to describe this game is "if Persona 5 was a Fire Emblem" as there amanything you can do outside like interacting with townsfolk. The combat is as great as expected although I thought theteachingmechanics is a bit wonky and tacky. Overall a great game despite some major flaws, plus a huge point for high replay ability .9/10 for me!!!!

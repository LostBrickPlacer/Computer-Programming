                Rune Factory 4: Special is an interesting case as I didn't think I would enjoy this game as much as I did. The game is esentially life-sim + farm-sim + dating-sim. It's a very versatile game that includes every single bit that makes the series Animal Crossing or Harvest Moon great. The combat is suprisingly entertaining and the cast is all-around lovely people. The only problem is that you can tell this game was not made recently but rather ported. Rf4 was originally a 3DS title and hence, it is understandable if you find the art style a little old or jarring looking. Also, the voice acting is great but rather sparse and limited. In celebration that Rune Factory 5 is coming, I thought that I would try out 4 and wasn't dissapointed. 8/10 for me!

        <p>
            Canada's first cooks, the Indigenous Peoples, are known to have used more than 500 plant species for food. They cultivated and foraged a variety of plants, hunted animals in the air, water and land. They also used various tools to boil, smoke, preserve and roast their food. The arrival of the French and English brought in more ingredients and new cooking techniques. Today, many of Canada's traditional dishes bear the mark of these Indigenous, French and English influences.

                Canadian cuisine, namely its reliance on seasonality, multiculturism, wild foods, regional dishes, and the priveleging of ingredients over recipes. Indigenous food in particular is considered very Canadian.
